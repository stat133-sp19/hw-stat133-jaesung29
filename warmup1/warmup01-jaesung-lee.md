**Jarek Yeager** was a [human](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Human) [male](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sexes) [mechanic](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Technician) who owned a [repair shop](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yeager%27s_repairs) on the [Colossus](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Colossus) during the [era](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/New_Republic_Era) of the [New Republic](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/New_Republic). A former [Rebel pilot](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_pilot) and veteran of the [Galactic Civil War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Civil_War), Yeager once served with the [Alliance to Restore the Republic](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_to_Restore_the_Republic). After the war, he sought a quiet, peaceful life and, therefore, retired to a [refueling](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel) installation located on the [ocean](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ocean) [planet](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Planet) [Castilon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Castilon) in [the galaxy](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_galaxy)'s [Outer Rim Territories](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim_Territories).

Baked Buffalo Wings
===================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SERVINGS:** VARIES BY IF MY HUSBAND IS THERE **TIME:** 1 HOUR PLUS OVERNIGHT **SOURCE:** [THE BUFFALO NEW YORK COOKBOOK](https://www.amazon.com/Buffalo-New-York-Cookbook-Crowd-Pleasing/dp/1682683230/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1682683230&pd_rd_r=96d3958e-232d-11e9-8307-3d1db5d50469&pd_rd_w=TD5Zv&pd_rd_wg=L5JhA&pf_rd_p=6725dbd6-9917-451d-beba-16af7874e407&pf_rd_r=C0H6P9QPK6Q1H2TX9JE7&psc=1&refRID=C0H6P9QPK6Q1H2TX9JE7&linkCode=sl1&tag=smitten-20&linkId=5d3ea2a4b1ed671d1c1d7e02c3dc69b2&language=en_US)

*Cooking time will vary by the size of wingettes (wings separated at the joint into drumettes and flats, wingtips discarded or [set aside for stock](https://smittenkitchen.com/2013/11/perfect-uncluttered-chicken-stock/)). Some are small enough that you¡¯ll have a dozen per pound; shown here are evidently from poultry behemoths with 6 drumettes to a pound. You serving sizes will vary accordingly, too, but a pound per person for a long game isn¡¯t my husband argues, an excessive amount to keep in mind. In fact, he wouldn¡¯t mind a few more.*

*I can fit about 3 pounds of chicken wings on one large sheet tray; any more, you¡¯ll probably need two, which is only pesky as you try to find room for them in your fridge overnight.*

##### Ingredients

-   1 to 4 pounds chicken wings that have been cut into flats and drumettes
-   1 1/2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons baking powder (using 1 1/2 teaspoons per pound)
-   1 to 4 teaspoons kosher salt (using 1 teaspoon per pound; [use less salt](https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/06/not-all-salts-are-created-equally/) if you¡¯re not using Diamond brand)
-   2 tablespoons hot sauce (Frank¡¯s RedHot is traditional) per pound of wings
-   1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter per pound of wings
-   8 To serve (optional): Homemade Blue Cheese Dressing (below), plus celery and carrot sticks

##### No need for special kitchen tools

##### Steps of the Recipe

1.  Line a large baking sheet with foil and set an oven-safe cooling rack on top. I lightly coat mine with nonstick spray, but it¡¯s probably not necessary. Pat wings dry with a paper towel, and then, in a large bowl, toss them with 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon kosher salt *per pound of wings*, until thoroughly coated. Arrange them on the rack with some space between them (the surface will not dry and crisp as well where they touch) and place in your refrigerator uncovered for 8 to 24 hours.

2.  When you¡¯re ready to bake them, heat your oven to 450 degrees, with a rack set in the top half of your oven. Bake your wings for 20 minutes, flip them with tongs or a spatula, bake them for another 15 minutes, flip them back over again, and then for 15 final minutes, for a total roasting time of 50 minutes. You might need up to 5 minutes longer for larger wings. Wings are done with they are browned and crisp.

3.  While the wings roast, make Buffalo wing sauce. In a medium saucepan, for each pound of wings, combine 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons (for a hotter sauce) to 2 tablespoons (for a mild, more buttery sauce) unsalted butter over medium heat until melted, whisking to combine. Set aside. Make Blue Cheese Dressing, if you wish (recipe below) and prepare carrots and celery.

4.  When wings are done, roll each in prepared Buffalo wing sauce. Serve with fixings of your choice. Eat immediately.

Euclidean Distance
==================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\\overline{pq})$

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$d(p,q)=d(q,p)=\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+\\dots+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}$$

$$=\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_i-p\_i)^2}$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$||p||=\\sqrt{p\_1^2+p\_2^2+\\dots+p\_n^2}=\\sqrt{p\\cdot p}$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
